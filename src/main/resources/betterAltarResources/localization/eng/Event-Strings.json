    "DESCRIPTIONS": [
      "In front of you sits an altar to a forgotten god. NL Atop the altar sits an ornate female statue with arms outstretched. NL She calls out to you, demanding sacrifice.",
      "As you gently set the idol onto the altar a #bcold wind swirls throughout the room. NL The arms of the statue begin to discolor and crumble. NL NL Your #ygolden #yidol begins to dull in color and begins bleeding from its eyes. NL The bleeding never ceases.",
      "You stand on the altar and cut your wrists. NL As the #rblood spills out in sacrifice, the arms of the statue reach out and close around your eyes. NL Everything goes dark. NL You wake up a short time later feeling a new potential surging through you.",
      "You lash out and smash the statue in front of you, breaking the magical hold the room had placed upon you. NL A dark wail echoes all around you, and you can feel the #p~cursed~ #p~magic~ seep into your bones."
